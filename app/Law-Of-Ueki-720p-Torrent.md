I have a hacked PSP Go with firmware 6.60 and custom firmware pro b10 installed. I want to play some ISO games on it, so I downloaded some ISO files from various websites and copied them to the ISO folder in the game section of my PSP Go's memory card. However, when I check the game folder on my PSP Go, none of the games show up. The only thing that changes is that the available memory on my PSP Go decreases by the size of the ISO file (for example, from 14 GB to 13 GB). I have tried different games and different sources, but none of them work. I have also formatted my PSP Go, but that did not help either. I am very frustrated and I need some assistance. Can anyone please help me fix this problem?

I have followed some online tutorials on how to hack my PSP Go and install custom firmware on it. I have also downloaded some ISO tools and plugins that are supposed to make the ISO games work. However, none of them seem to make any difference. I have checked the settings and configurations of my PSP Go, but I cannot find anything wrong. I have also tried different memory cards and USB cables, but the result is the same.
  
I have searched online for solutions to this problem, but I have not found any that work for me. Most of the answers are either outdated, irrelevant, or too complicated for me to understand. Some of them suggest that I need to update or downgrade my firmware, but I am afraid that might brick my PSP Go or make it lose its hack. Some of them also say that I need to convert the ISO files to a different format, but I do not know how to do that or what format to use.
  
I am really desperate and frustrated. I have spent a lot of time and money on this project, but I cannot get it to work. I just want to play some ISO games on my PSP Go without any hassle. Is that too much to ask? Please, if anyone knows how to fix this problem, please help me. I would really appreciate it.
